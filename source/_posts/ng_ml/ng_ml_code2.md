开始第二次编程作业，对应课程内容第三周，第六章，逻辑回归。本编程作业中没我们将在两个不同的数据集上实现逻辑回归。

第二周作业包含文件:
```
ex2.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through the exercise
ex2 reg.m - Octave/MATLAB script for the later parts of the exercise
ex2data1.txt - Training set for the ﬁrst half of the
exercise ex2data2.txt - Training set for the second half of the exercise
submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to our servers
mapFeature.m - Function to generate polynomial features
plotDecisionBoundary.m - Function to plot classiﬁer’s decision boundary
[*] plotData.m - Function to plot 2D classiﬁcation data
[*] sigmoid.m - Sigmoid Function
[*] costFunction.m - Logistic Regression Cost Function
[*] predict.m - Logistic Regression Prediction Function
[*] costFunctionReg.m - Regularized Logistic Regression Cost
```
